# A Basic About Me!
Since this is not a PowerPoint, I can't really make it funny.
- Hello there! I'm Kyle "CoffeeKremer" Kremer.
  - CoffeeKremer comes from a nickname my friends gave me! I'm not joking about that.
- I like coding, and I'm very interested/invested in my Blue Waters game.
  - The public game is found [here!](https://www.javawizard.org/BlueWaters/)
- I’m currently learning C++ and the SFML library.
  - This is to make a desktop port of Blue Waters.
- Some things I'm bad about with coding:
  1. Optimization (I've only been coding for about a full year, I'm pretty much a rookie.)
  2. Hard Coding (I'm sometimes too lazy to make my code flexable.)
  3. Spelling (I once spelt 'standard' as 'standred' and my CS teacher did **NOT** like that and changed it while he was debugging my project.)
- Honestly, I kinda just wanna make video games. I've only been playing them for most of my life.
  - I would prefer to move away from the p5.js Javascript library, and use a real language like C++ for game development.
  - Although no one seems to really teach C/C++ anymore.
- I self-taught myself the very basics of Java and a bit more C++.
  - I don't really forsee myself using Java.

Indeed, I concure, that is a correct statement.
